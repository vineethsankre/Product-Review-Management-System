In this project, we will build a Spring Boot application to offer a REST service for the 'NxtTrendz' application. Within 'NxtTrendz', users can delve into reviews associated with distinct products, gaining insights into user sentiments and feedback.

For this endeavor, the main entities to be modeled are `Product` and `Review`. The `Review` entity has a Many-to-One relationship with the `Product` entity.
